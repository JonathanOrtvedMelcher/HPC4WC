Notes for table 1:

  This table shows functions that have significant exclusive sample
    hits, averaged across ranks.
  For further explanation, see the "General table notes" below,
    or use:  pat_report -v -O samp_profile ...

Observation:  MPI utilization

    No suggestions were made because each node has only one rank.


Observation:  Program sensitivity to memory latency

    This program did not appear to be limited by memory latency
    throughout its entire execution, though individual functions or
    regions might be.


Notes for table 3:

  This table shows memory traffic for numa nodes, taking for each numa
    node the maximum value across nodes. It also shows the balance in
    memory traffic by showing the top 3 and bottom 3 node values.
  For further explanation, see the "General table notes" below,
    or use:  pat_report -v -O mem_bw ...

Notes for table 4:

  This table shows energy and power usage for the nodes with the
    maximum, mean, and minimum usage, as well as the sum of usage over
    all nodes.
    Energy and power for accelerators is also shown, if applicable.
  For further explanation, see the "General table notes" below,
    or use:  pat_report -v -O program_energy ...
